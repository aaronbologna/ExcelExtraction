# Projects

Thousands of Engineering Change Notice (ECN) Excel files are distributed every year.
Since each of these is a separate document, reporting on them is nearly impossible.
This project takes all these disparate files, extracts the key information, and saves all the information into a SQL database.
We now have the ability to generated metrics and develop Power BI dashboards that can be used to quickly look up information.
